## My ¢2

My name is Aleksei Matiushkin. I was born on October 0, 1973, in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Nowadays I got used to a nickname “mudasobwa,” proudly granted by rwandian linguists:

<blockquote><p>Kinyarwanda, the language spoken by most Rwandans, has no words for many basic technical and computing terms, including the very word “computer,” explained Steve Murphy, organizer of the project. After debating whether to borrow English or French terms or come up with their own native word, the group settled on “mudasobwa,” which roughly translates to “something or someone that does not make mistakes.”</p>

## In One Fell Swoop

I have an experience in C/C++ pointing, Ruby railing, SQL querying, Java threads woodoo magic (and woodoo pleasure since 6.0), Perl crypting, Javascript handling, AJAX inplacing, Python tabbing, LISP bracketing. I have been working with so many unix variants (HP-UX, Solaris, Minix, Linux) that I finally learned the proper plural form ‘unices’. I have managed the jabber client-server apps in Yandex, led warehouse management apps for US customers, developed the metamodelling tool in Berlin and created the medical apps in Saint-Petersburg.
